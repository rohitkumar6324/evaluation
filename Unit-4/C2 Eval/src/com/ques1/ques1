Question : Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?

Answer : 
         Difference between IS-A & Has-A relationship :-
          
         Is-A relationship --> When two classes have child-parent relationship it is is called 
         IS-A relationship. For e.g-->
         class Animal{
         
         }
         
         class Lion extends Animal{
             
         }
         
         Here, Animal & Lion has IS-A relationship;
         
         
         Has-A relationship ---> When once class contains a variable which has object reference of
         another class, it is known as Has-A relationship. For e.g --->
         
         class Car {
             int tyres;
             Engine engine;
         }
         
         class Engine{
             
         }
         
         Here, we can see that Car class has an variable with object reference as Engine. Hence, 
         Car & Engine has Has-A relationship;
         
         
         
         
         
         Access Modifiers :-
         
         Access Modifiers define the scope of the class,method,constructor,variable inside local class
         /package/global from where we can access them.
         
         There are four types of access modifiers :-
         
         1)Public :- We can access public modifiers from anywhere inside or outside the package.
         2)Default :- We can only access default modifiers within the same package only.
         3)Private :- We can only access private modifiers within the same class only.
         4)Protected :- We can only access the protected modifiers within the same package only through
         inheritance ,i.e, we have to have another class a child class if we want to access protected
         modifiers.
